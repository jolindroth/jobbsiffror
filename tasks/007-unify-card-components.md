# Task 007: Unify Card Components in Vacancies Page

## Objective

Fix UI inconsistencies in the vacancies page by making the VacancyFilters component use the same Card component structure as the statistics cards and chart components.

## Current Issues Identified

1. **VacancyFilters component** uses manual div styling instead of the Card component
2. **Missing shadow** on the filter component (other cards have shadow-xs/shadow-sm)
3. **Inconsistent visual hierarchy** - doesn't follow established card patterns
4. **Manual styling** instead of using the standardized Card component system

## Files to Modify

### 1. `/src/components/vacancy-filters.tsx`

**Changes needed:**

- Replace the manual div wrapper with proper Card component
- Import Card, CardHeader, CardContent from `@/components/ui/card`
- Apply consistent styling to match other cards on the page
- Ensure the component maintains its current functionality while using proper card structure

### 2. `/src/app/dashboard/vacancies/[[...filters]]/page.tsx`

**Changes needed:**

- Update the statistics cards container styling to ensure VacancyFilters matches
- Ensure consistent spacing and visual hierarchy
- Verify that the enhanced card styling (gradient, shadows) is applied consistently

## Implementation Details

### VacancyFilters Component Structure

**Current structure:**

```
<div className="relative">
  <div className="bg-card mb-8 rounded-lg border p-6">
    // Filter content
  </div>
  // Loading overlay
</div>
```

**Target structure:**

```
<div className="relative">
  <Card className="mb-8 @container/card">
    <CardContent className="p-6">
      // Filter content
    </CardContent>
  </Card>
  // Loading overlay
</div>
```

### Visual Consistency Requirements

1. **Shadow**: Apply same shadow as other cards (shadow-xs or shadow-sm)
2. **Border radius**: Ensure consistent rounding (rounded-xl from Card component)
3. **Background**: Use Card component's background handling
4. **Spacing**: Maintain current internal spacing while using Card structure
5. **Container queries**: Apply @container/card class for responsive behavior

### Styling Harmonization

- Ensure VacancyFilters gets the same enhanced styling as statistics cards
- Apply consistent gap spacing between all card components
- Maintain current responsive behavior
- Preserve existing functionality (loading states, navigation, etc.)

## Expected Outcome

- All card components on the vacancies page will use the same underlying Card component
- Visual consistency across filters, statistics, and chart components
- Maintained functionality with improved visual hierarchy
- Consistent shadow, border, and spacing treatment

## Status

- [x] Task created
- [x] Implementation completed

## Implementation Summary

**Completed Changes:**

1. **VacancyFilters Component (`/src/components/vacancy-filters.tsx`)**:

   - Added Card and CardContent imports
   - Replaced manual div wrapper with proper Card component
   - Applied `@container/card` class for consistency
   - Maintained all existing functionality and styling

2. **Vacancies Page (`/src/app/dashboard/vacancies/[[...filters]]/page.tsx`)**:
   - Wrapped VacancyFilters in enhanced styling container
   - Applied same gradient, shadow, and background styling as statistics cards
   - Ensured visual consistency across all card components

**Results:**

- ✅ VacancyFilters now uses the same Card component as other components
- ✅ Consistent shadow (`shadow-xs`) applied to all cards
- ✅ Unified gradient background styling
- ✅ Maintained responsive behavior and functionality
- ✅ Visual hierarchy now consistent across the page
